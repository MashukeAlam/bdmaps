# Documentation: Green, Yellow, Red Choices Logic

## Overview
This project visualizes the districts of Bangladesh using SVG paths in an HTML file. Each district is represented by a `<path>` element with a unique `id` corresponding to the district name. The logic for assigning colors (green, yellow, red) to these districts is typically based on some data-driven criteria, such as status, value, or category.

## Color Assignment Logic

### 1. SVG Structure
- Each district is a `<path>` element with a unique `id` (e.g., `id="nawabganj"`).
- The `style` attribute of each path controls its fill color and stroke.

### 2. Color Choices
- **Green**: Indicates a positive or safe status (e.g., low risk, completed, available).
- **Yellow**: Indicates a warning or intermediate status (e.g., moderate risk, in progress, caution).
- **Red**: Indicates a negative or critical status (e.g., high risk, unavailable, urgent action needed).

### 3. Logic for Assigning Colors
The logic for assigning green, yellow, or red to a district is typically implemented in JavaScript. The process is as follows:

1. **Data Source**: There is usually a data object or array mapping each district to a status or value.
   ```js
   const districtStatus = {
     nawabganj: 'green',
     bogra: 'yellow',
     natore: 'red',
     // ...
   };
   ```

2. **Color Mapping**: Define the color codes for each status.
   ```js
   const colorMap = {
     green: '#4CAF50',   // or any green shade
     yellow: '#FFEB3B',  // or any yellow shade
     red: '#F44336'      // or any red shade
   };
   ```

3. **Applying Colors**: Iterate over the districts and set the `fill` style of each path based on its status.
   ```js
   Object.keys(districtStatus).forEach(function(districtId) {
     const status = districtStatus[districtId];
     const color = colorMap[status];
     const path = document.getElementById(districtId);
     if (path) {
       path.style.fill = color;
     }
   });
   ```

### 4. Dynamic Updates
- The logic can be extended to update colors dynamically based on user input, real-time data, or events.
- Event listeners can be added to paths for interactivity (e.g., click to change color, show tooltip).

### 5. Example Use Case
Suppose you want to color districts based on COVID-19 risk levels:
- Green: Low risk
- Yellow: Medium risk
- Red: High risk

You would update the `districtStatus` object accordingly and run the color assignment logic.

## Summary
- Each district is an SVG path with a unique ID.
- Colors (green, yellow, red) are assigned based on a data-driven status.
- JavaScript is used to map statuses to color codes and update the SVG paths.
- The logic is flexible and can be adapted for various use cases.
